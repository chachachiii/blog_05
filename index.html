            <p>Powercast's latest invention Ubiquity is trying to improve the way we charge our devices wirelessly. They are using radio frequency technology to charge low power devices. By using a transmitter, it converts the radio frequencies into DC, essentially charging your low-powered devices safely from a distance. Depending how low-powered your device is, the further away you can charge from the transmitter, with normal low-powered devices charging from within several feet, and ultra low-powered devices charging from up to 120 feet away.</p>
